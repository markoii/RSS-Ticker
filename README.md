RSS Ticker loads your Firefox Live Bookmarks and scrolls their entries across your screen while you surf. It's perfect for staying informed without having to actively browse entries in an RSS reader.

This branch contains a version of RSS-Ticker with all requests to the original branch, including:

    Hide items older than n days
    Use a folder as root folder for all feeds
    Show only the latest n item by feed
    Show visited items with other font-style/color
    Changing the item width doesn't reflect in the toolbar
    Fix the "no feeds found" page when Firefox closes unexpectedly
